title: Define users
---
If you have not defined the users and usage of your digitised collection, in the planning phase (Chapter 1), you should start now.

First step in creating access to your digitized or digital material is to define the audiences who are going to use the materials. A comprehensive understanding of potential users is critical for the provision of access to digital heritage objects and broader digital preservation initiatives. Knowledge about these user groups must inform all aspects of the lifecycle, but especially in determining the most appropriate access delivery solutions, considering available resources and technology. Identifying user communities and their needs must be approached systematically and objectively, focusing on their desired actions and the functionality that the repository can provide.

The approach for gathering this information may vary depending on the organizational context. Some of the potential tools and options include analyzing current usage, surveys, focus groups, interviews, use cases, and task analysis. It is crucial to consider both existing and non-users while carrying out user analysis. Although non-users are harder to interact with, understanding their current barriers to use and identifying potential new market sectors can be valuable. Therefore, understanding users' needs and behavior is a vital aspect of providing digital access to heritage objects and ensuring their long-term preservation.
