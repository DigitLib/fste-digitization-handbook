title: Define platform
---
Once you have identified the user and his needs, the next step is to select an appropriate platform for the material. This may be your own platform, an institutional or national platform like the French POP https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en/Documentation-space/Bases-de-donnees/Fiches-bases-de-donnees/POP-the-open-heritage-platform , or international digital repositories - for example Zenodo https://zenodo.org/   
NB. Data should be as standardised as possible to help management
  
There are several questions you should ask when choosing an online platform, including budgetary requirements and ongoing costs, whether other collections use the platform, if it supports the license or label you want to use, if it displays your content in ways that are attractive to your users, if you can customize the look and feel, if it follows web accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities, and if it is easy to use for users and your team (staff, volunteers).

Other important considerations include whether the platform allows you to catalog your content online, display your cataloging data properly, group your content into categories to make it easy for users to find, and whether the platform technology is suitable for your users (e.g., access via a mobile phone).

In addition, you should consider how the data is stored, backed up, and recoverable, whether it is easy to download the entire collection as backup or to place elsewhere (data portability), what sort of support is accessible or provided by the platform service, if it is compatible with the rights and permissions in your materials, and if it allows you to track user engagement (views, downloads).
