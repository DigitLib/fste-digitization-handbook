title: Protect the assets both during and after digitisation
---
Regard physical conservational aspects as part of risk management during digitisation.

Carry out a preliminary study or analysis to determine the potential impact/damage of the technique used.

Specify from the beginning of the digitisation project who would handle the cultural heritage assets, and who may come close to them.

Make sure that any person handling the cultural heritage assets or operating any moving digitisation equipment is competent to do that.

Have professional conservators oversee the handling of objects, and involve them from the planning stage.

Ensure that appropriate insurance coverage is in place.

After digitisation, avoid as much as possible direct handling of the assets in question, using instead the digital twins created.

Read more about careful handling of assets in chapters 3 Digitization of the selected objects or materials and 4 Preparation for publication and curation of the digitized objects or materials.
