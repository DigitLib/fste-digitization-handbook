title: Invest in knowledge of technologies, processes and content
---
Using technologies to digitise and document cultural heritage is becoming more commonplace, and knowledge of such technologies and processes is becoming increasingly more valuable.

Knowledge of the used technologies, processes and content is valuable regardless of whether you digitise in-house or outsource, so it is highly recommended to acquire at least basic understanding.

When you engage for the first time in digitisation, begin with a limited scope and a limited number of assets to acquire knowledge.
Outsourcing of digitisation, too, requires an understanding of the technologies, processes and content involved.

Training courses on all kinds of digitisation (images, texts, audio/video, objects etc.) for cultural heritage or on technologies more generally, are also available online via the major e-learning and other platforms.
