title: Identify the different versions and formats suitable for the different use cases targeted
---
Depending on the (re-)use of the data, high quality (like high resolution) or lower quality data are suitable.
Use the raw data to produce a master file of the highest attainable quality, which would serve as the basis for simplification and conversion into different formats to serve different purposes.

Make the content available in multiple formats, of which at least one should be an open format.
Follow standards and best practices, and choose open and/or commonly used formats for your specific type of digitisation. You may find the Europeana Knowledge Base (listed in the Tools section below) a useful tool. 

Choose a viewer/platform for delivery that works on a range of devices and which can also be supported in Europeana.
Read more about  the different versions and formats in Chapter 3 Digitization of the selected objects or materials and following.
