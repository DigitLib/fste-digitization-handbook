title: Clarify copyright aspects and plan for open and broad access
---
dentify the rights applying and the individuals and organisations holding them, and engage in discussions with them prior to starting the digitisation.
Define the copyright that is compatible with the identified rights, and that would be most suitable for the purpose(s) for which the digitisation takes place.
Follow and encourage adherence to the principle that what is in the public domain should remain in the public domain after digitisation.
Integrate licensing and copyright provisions into your access and re-use agreement, and include such copyright information in the metadata.

When outsourcing, ensure that the call and contract require that any copyright (or associated rights), including for metadata, be transferred to the beneficiary institution or released into the public domain, and not reserved by the service provider.
Plan from the beginning how the collection will be made available to your target users.
Provide broad public access, storing and distributing data via open public platforms as well as self-hosting. 

When publishing on Europeana, open licenses are much encouraged; it will increase your quality rating and bring additional exposure of your data! Read more about Europeana’s requirements in the “Tools” section at the end of this chapter.
Ensure the content is also available in open formats, in order to prevent vendor lock-in or restrictive re-use.
If possible, include the metadata captured as machine-readable interlinked data (Linked Open Data), in order to enhance findability.
