title: Select what to digitise and for what use cases or user groups
---
When you have decided on the “why” of digitisation, the “what” question needs to be addressed. To help you with that, see chapter 2 Selection of the objects or materials to be digitised. Some important questions to consider are for instance:

- Is -part of - your collection, materials, building or site at risk?

- How would your targeted audience use the content that you have digitised?

- What type of cultural heritage are you planning to digitise? 

- Who should be involved?

- How about the future? 

Read more about selecting what to digitise in Chapter 2 Selection of the objects and materials to be digitised.
