title: Use the right equipment, methods and workflows
---
The equipment and methods used have to match the category of cultural heritage involved and the quality needed for the purpose of the digitised assets.

The size and characteristics of the target, the intended uses, the logistical aspects, the budget available, the timing and the environmental conditions all have an influence on the choice of equipment and methods.

Carefully evaluate equipment outputs. What may be suitable for some uses, may not be suitable for other uses.
Read more about the use of the right equipment, methods and workflows in the following chapters of the Handbook.
