title: Maintenance and improvement of the (meta-) data (data management)
---
Everyone wants their content to be easily findable, accessible, interoperable and ready for use (the FAIR principles). Not only now or in the near future, but also in the long run. 
It is necessary to think about the future right from the start (as already explained in chapter 1 Planning of the project). 

The most important issues to consider in data management are (long term) storage of data, standards, metadata (to explain what the data is about and make it findable), rights and access licenses. For long term preservation of  (meta-)data, the archiving of the data, it all starts with selecting what to keep and in what format. 
In the Process section below, these issues will be explained from the perspective of the FAIR principles and best practices of data management.
