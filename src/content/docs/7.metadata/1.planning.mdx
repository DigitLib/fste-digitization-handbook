title: Data management planning

Data management is all about making your work efficient and creating more value for your data for yourself and others, during and after your digitisation project. You can create a (simple) Data Management Plan to document how you plan to handle your data now and in the future.

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document you develop at the start of your digitisation project which outlines all aspects of managing your data, both during and after your project. It contains, among others:
* what data you will collect (type, size)
* who is responsible for management of the (meta-)data?
* where you will store them, who will have access to them and how access is regulated
* how often you will back-up your data
* how you will document your data
* the versioning strategy and folder structure you will use
* whether there are any privacy and ownership issues
* whether and how you are planning to archive and share your data.
