title: Archiving

The last but also very important part of the Digitization process is archiving. That means how to store the master copies made by capturing. 

It is recommended to have 3 copies of master files on 3 different locations.

The simplest is to get an external HDD storage just copy the files and store them somewhere else. External HDD storage today is not too expensive and is affordable to many. Many small CHIs use only one external HDD, which is better than none. Before starting capturing, while configuring the computer use a larger HDD for internal storage and one external HDD.

This is important because it saves a master file if something happens to the computer (for example, an electricity incident, virus erase or lock filesâ€¦), where the initial files are stored.
