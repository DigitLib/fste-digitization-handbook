title: Audio Capture
---
### Intro
Audio capturing is specific because it depends on the type of source. The history of audio recording is long and the formats were changed during the period. In this section we will focus on some most common formats that can be found in smaller CHIs. 

- LP and singles Records (33, 45 and 78 rpm)
- audio cassette
- compact disk CD
- audio recorders

This formats have appropriate device:

- gramphone for Records
- audio cassette player
- CD player

The equipement
- computer
- external USB sound card
- appropriate device
- headphones or speaker

### Use
For audio capturing it is recommended to use an external USB audio card, there are on the market decent audio cards and digital mixers (2 channels) that will give a good and quality recording. The advantage of using an external audio card is in its implemented A/D converter (analogue to digital signal converter) which converts audio signal to digital. The quality in external audio cards is better than integrated audio card on PC or laptop. Another advantage is the variety of input options, RCA stereo (red and white chinch), for example, which fits to most audio devices output.
.

One of the bad things in audio capturing is time, all processes must go 1:1, how long the record is so long is capturing. If you have a cassette that lasts 90 minutes, plan to record 90 minutes.
The good thing is that you need an audio device, audio card, computer, cables, speakers or headphone and material. Just plug in everything, press the record on the computer and listen to it.
Audio recorders can be used for interview recording (for example an interesting member of a community), urban surroundings, birds, â€¦ All models today are digital and can be easily transferred on a computer.

### The process
- Prepare the material
- On device (gramophone, audio cassette player, CD player), check the output format (mostly RCA red and white) and plug the cables
- On audio use line in chanel and plug the cable following the colors (red and white)
- On computer open a audio recording software and press Record or REC (red dot)
- Play audio from device
- Record the file in WAV format, most common is 44.1 kHz and 16 bit. Mono recording to mono file, stereo recording to stereo file.


### Most common problems
Capturing audio brings some regular problems with it.

- Gramophone records mostly have little or bigger scratches on it and dust. Before play it is recommended to clean a record with a small soft record cleaner (can be find in almost every music shop). Most records, during play, produce pop and clicks. This can be cleaned in a software, for this more on digital preparation. Jump over and back the part of recording, which is harder to repeat in software because this over jumped part will miss in the captured file.

-  Audio cassette players mostly have a problem with a dirty head (a piece which reads the tape) which is cleanable, the quality of recording on tape can be low, with noise and low signal level. This problem, also can be solved in software, later in this more on digital preparation.

- Compact disk, also can be scratched which produces a jump for some amount of recording, or constant back to the same part of recording. If that happens there are polishing kits available that can repair damaged plastic surface of disc. But the success of repair depends on the amount of plastic damage. Also clicks can be present on CD, which means that the disc is near to the end of life and unusable anymore.
